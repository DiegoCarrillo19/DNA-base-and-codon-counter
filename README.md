# DNA-base-and-codon-counter


DNA base and codon counter is script in Perl.

This script counts nitrogenous bases and codons present in a DNA sequence

For the correct use of the script:

   1. You must not use the sequence in FASTA format. The script can read other characters present in the file.
   2. Use only one sequence per file.
   3. The sequence must start with the start codon and end with a stop codon.
   4. The length of the sequence must be a multiple of three.




Two sequences downloaded from GenBank are included as an example in this repository. Credits to the authors.
